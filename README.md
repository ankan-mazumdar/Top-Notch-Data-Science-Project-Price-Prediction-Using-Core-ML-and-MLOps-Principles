### Design Patterns Implementation

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Feature Engineering**

```164:198:src/feature_engineering.py
        return df_transformed
```

- Allows swapping different feature engineering approaches
- Implementations include: LogTransformation, StandardScaling, MinMaxScaling, OneHotEncoding

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Data Splitting**

```11:27:src/data_splitter.py
# -----------------------------------------------
# This class defines a common interface for different data splitting strategies.
# Subclasses must implement the split_data method.
class DataSplittingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def split_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame, target_column: str):
        """
        Abstract method to split the data into training and testing sets.

        Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame to be split.
        target_column (str): The name of the target column.

        Returns:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test: The training and testing splits for features and target.

## Summary
**"Building a Top-Notch Data Science Project: House Price Prediction Using Core ML and MLOps Principles"**

This project demonstrates the combined use of core ML techniques and MLOps principles to build a robust, production-grade pipeline for house price prediction. It includes CI/CD, experiment tracking, and design patterns that ensure the model is reproducible, scalable, and aligned with industry standards.

## Key Components

### Core ML
- **Focus on Data Understanding**: Time is allocated for thorough data analysis and assumption testing, which significantly influences algorithm selection and feature engineering steps.
- **Model Compatibility**: Data validation and assumption checks are integrated to ensure the chosen model performs effectively on the dataset.

### MLOps
- **Comprehensive MLOps Framework**: Integrates tools
-  ZenML (easy to use orchestrated MLOps framework seamlessly integrating other ML tools/workflows to build fullstack of it, relatively easy to understand, we understand the pipelins workflows) and MLFlow (inegration of ZenML where we use to track our deployments for a production-ready ML pipeline.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd9e9c9c-49d3-47c9-ae42-31b2a8109b71)

Factory Design Pattern

Imagine you run a coffee shop. Customers can order different types of coffee, but the process of
making coffee follows a similar pattern. You have a general coffee-making machine (the factory)
that can be used to make different types of coffee (products) like Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino.
CoffeeMachine (Factory): Has a method to make coffee
• Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino (ConcreteProducts): Different types of coffee that can be
made by the machine.

Strategy Pattern

Imagine you're developing an e-commerce application. Customers can choose different payment
methods like Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin. Each payment method has a different implementation,
but the overall process is the same: the customer pays for the order.
• PaymentMethod (Strategy): An interface that defines how payments are processed.
• CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, BitcoinPayment (ConcreteStrategies): Different
implementations of payment processing.
• ShoppingCart (Context): Uses a payment method to process a customer's payment.

Template Pattern

Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you run a restaurant with a set menu for different cuisines. Each cuisine (like Italian,
Chinese, or Indian) has a specific sequence of courses: appetizer, main course, dessert, and
beverage. The sequence of serving these courses is the same, but the dishes served at each step
vary depending on the cuisine.
For example, in an Italian meal, the appetizer might be bruschetta, the main course could be pasta
dessert might be tiramisu, and the beverage could be a glass of wine. In a Chinese meal, the
appetizer could be spring rolls, the main course might be stir-fried noodles, dessert could be
fortune cookies, and the beverage could be tea.
The template here is the overall dining sequence: appetizer, main course, dessert, and beverage.
The customizable steps are the specific dishes served at each stage, which change based on the
cuisine.

## Detailed Project Structure

### Data Loading & Ingestion
- **Why Factory Design Pattern**: The Factory pattern is utilized to handle various data formats dynamically. It provides flexibility in data ingestion by creating different "products" (i.e., data types like CSV, JSON, zip) from a single "factory" (data ingestion class). This design ensures scalability and the capacity to adapt to additional data types with minimal changes.
- **How It’s Better**: Unlike hardcoded file handlers, this approach uses a generalized interface to recognize and process different data formats automatically. It saves time and simplifies adding new formats by extending a base class instead of editing existing code.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Source Versatility**: The Factory pattern manages all data sources and formats through its extensible interface.
  - **Type Checking & Error Handling**: Validates file types before ingestion, preventing issues that arise from unsupported file types. For instance, zip files are verified and extracted using Python’s `zipfile` library, ensuring only valid data is processed.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Traditional hardcoded ingestion scripts can handle specific formats but lack scalability, require significant manual code adjustments, and are challenging to maintain across multiple formats.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Why Julius AI**: Julius AI is incorporated for fast, thorough data analysis, quick insights, and visualizations, significantly reducing the time spent on manual EDA. It supports interactive data visualizations and quick experimentation, allowing for a more insightful and streamlined approach to data exploration.
- **How It’s Better**: Compared to traditional manual EDA, Julius AI saves considerable time and effort by automating many exploratory steps. It includes community suggestions and pre-built workflows that aid in feature selection, multivariate analysis, and identifying relationships between variables, thus creating a solid foundation for model-building decisions.

- **EDA Strategy Pattern**: The Strategy pattern allows easy switching between various data inspection strategies, such as summary statistics, missing value analysis, and multivariate relationships. By defining these strategies as separate modules, EDA becomes modular and easily extendable.
  - **Scalability**: This structure ensures EDA steps are reusable, well-organized, and easily adaptable to new datasets or analysis needs.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Performing EDA manually in a Jupyter notebook can work for smaller projects but is labor-intensive and error-prone for larger datasets. Julius AI, paired with the Strategy pattern, offers a faster, structured, and replicable alternative.

### Handling Missing Values & Outliers
- **Why Template Design Pattern**: To manage missing values effectively, a Template pattern is used to create reusable structures for missing value analysis. This approach standardizes handling processes, making it easier to spot missing patterns and structure preprocessing steps accordingly.
  - **Seaborn Heatmaps**: Heatmaps are used to visualize missing data distributions, with structured and random missingness guiding preprocessing decisions.
- **Outlier Detection & Normalization**: Outliers are detected using the Z-score method, which is a statistical approach that flags data points significantly deviating from the mean. This method is reliable for identifying unusual values in continuous data and supports decision-making in feature engineering.

- **How It’s Better**:
  - **Template Pattern Benefits**: By setting a base class for missing value analysis, handling missing data becomes modular, adaptable, and standardized, which is particularly useful for larger, complex datasets.
  - **Automated Z-Score Analysis**: Compared to manual outlier checks, Z-score automates and simplifies the identification of outliers, ensuring that skewed values are treated consistently.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Traditional approaches, such as manual thresholding for outliers, lack standardization and scalability. The Template pattern with Z-score outlier detection provides a robust and systematic alternative, especially in production settings where consistency is critical.

### Feature Engineering
- **Why Use One-Hot Encoding & Standard Scaling**: One-hot encoding handles categorical variables efficiently, transforming them into a format that machine learning models can interpret. Standard scaling ensures that numerical features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, making them suitable for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
  - **Log Transformations**: Log transformations are applied to certain features to reduce skewness and improve model interpretability.
- **How It’s Better**:
  - **Standard Scaling**: Normalizes the data, which is crucial for models that rely on distance-based calculations (e.g., linear regression, SVM).
  - **Automated Feature Pipeline**: The transformation process is embedded into the pipeline, ensuring the same transformations are applied every time, regardless of new data.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: While one-hot encoding and standard scaling are common, their automation within a pipeline ensures consistency across multiple runs, reducing the risk of human error and enhancing model reproducibility.

### Modeling & Deployment
- **Experiment Tracking & Deployment**: Using MLFlow, experiments are tracked meticulously, providing insights into model performance across different runs and configurations. This allows for quick model selection based on tracked metrics.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment ensure that any new model iteration is rigorously tested and ready for production without manual intervention.
- **How It’s Better**: Traditional deployment methods lack robust tracking and version control, making it challenging to reproduce or improve models. The automated CI/CD pipeline with experiment tracking addresses these limitations, creating a streamlined deployment process.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Manual deployment lacks the scalability and consistency required for production-grade models. MLFlow and ZenML create an effective ecosystem for deploying and maintaining models, even as new data or changes are introduced.
