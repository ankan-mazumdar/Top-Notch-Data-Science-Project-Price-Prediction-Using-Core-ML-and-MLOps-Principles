# Top-Notch-Data-Science-Project-Price-Prediction-Using-Core-ML-and-MLOps-Principles

## Summary
**"Building a Top-Notch Data Science Project: House Price Prediction Using Core ML and MLOps Principles"**

This project demonstrates the combined use of core ML techniques and MLOps principles to build a robust, production-grade pipeline for house price prediction. It includes CI/CD, experiment tracking, and design patterns that ensure the model is reproducible, scalable, and aligned with industry standards.

## Key Components

### Core ML
- **Focus on Data Understanding**: Time is allocated for thorough data analysis and assumption testing, which significantly influences algorithm selection and feature engineering steps.
- **Model Compatibility**: Data validation and assumption checks are integrated to ensure the chosen model performs effectively on the dataset.

### MLOps
- **Comprehensive MLOps Framework**: Integrates tools
-  ZenML (easy to use orchestrated MLOps framework seamlessly integrating other ML tools/workflows to build fullstack of it, relatively easy to understand, we understand the pipelins workflows) and MLFlow (inegration of ZenML where we use to track our deployments for a production-ready ML pipeline.
- **Pipeline Automation**: CI/CD pipelines automate the flow from data ingestion through deployment, enhancing reproducibility and robustness.

### Code Quality
- **Adoption of Design Patterns**: Uses design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Template) across modules, making code scalable, modular, and easier to maintain.

## Detailed Project Structure

### Data Loading & Ingestion
- **Why Factory Design Pattern**: The Factory pattern is utilized to handle various data formats dynamically. It provides flexibility in data ingestion by creating different "products" (i.e., data types like CSV, JSON, zip) from a single "factory" (data ingestion class). This design ensures scalability and the capacity to adapt to additional data types with minimal changes.
- **How It’s Better**: Unlike hardcoded file handlers, this approach uses a generalized interface to recognize and process different data formats automatically. It saves time and simplifies adding new formats by extending a base class instead of editing existing code.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Source Versatility**: The Factory pattern manages all data sources and formats through its extensible interface.
  - **Type Checking & Error Handling**: Validates file types before ingestion, preventing issues that arise from unsupported file types. For instance, zip files are verified and extracted using Python’s `zipfile` library, ensuring only valid data is processed.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Traditional hardcoded ingestion scripts can handle specific formats but lack scalability, require significant manual code adjustments, and are challenging to maintain across multiple formats.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Why Julius AI**: Julius AI is incorporated for fast, thorough data analysis, quick insights, and visualizations, significantly reducing the time spent on manual EDA. It supports interactive data visualizations and quick experimentation, allowing for a more insightful and streamlined approach to data exploration.
- **How It’s Better**: Compared to traditional manual EDA, Julius AI saves considerable time and effort by automating many exploratory steps. It includes community suggestions and pre-built workflows that aid in feature selection, multivariate analysis, and identifying relationships between variables, thus creating a solid foundation for model-building decisions.
- **EDA Strategy Pattern**: The Strategy pattern allows easy switching between various data inspection strategies, such as summary statistics, missing value analysis, and multivariate relationships. By defining these strategies as separate modules, EDA becomes modular and easily extendable.
  - **Scalability**: This structure ensures EDA steps are reusable, well-organized, and easily adaptable to new datasets or analysis needs.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Performing EDA manually in a Jupyter notebook can work for smaller projects but is labor-intensive and error-prone for larger datasets. Julius AI, paired with the Strategy pattern, offers a faster, structured, and replicable alternative.

### Handling Missing Values & Outliers
- **Why Template Design Pattern**: To manage missing values effectively, a Template pattern is used to create reusable structures for missing value analysis. This approach standardizes handling processes, making it easier to spot missing patterns and structure preprocessing steps accordingly.
  - **Seaborn Heatmaps**: Heatmaps are used to visualize missing data distributions, with structured and random missingness guiding preprocessing decisions.
- **Outlier Detection & Normalization**: Outliers are detected using the Z-score method, which is a statistical approach that flags data points significantly deviating from the mean. This method is reliable for identifying unusual values in continuous data and supports decision-making in feature engineering.
- **How It’s Better**:
  - **Template Pattern Benefits**: By setting a base class for missing value analysis, handling missing data becomes modular, adaptable, and standardized, which is particularly useful for larger, complex datasets.
  - **Automated Z-Score Analysis**: Compared to manual outlier checks, Z-score automates and simplifies the identification of outliers, ensuring that skewed values are treated consistently.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Traditional approaches, such as manual thresholding for outliers, lack standardization and scalability. The Template pattern with Z-score outlier detection provides a robust and systematic alternative, especially in production settings where consistency is critical.

### Feature Engineering
- **Why Use One-Hot Encoding & Standard Scaling**: One-hot encoding handles categorical variables efficiently, transforming them into a format that machine learning models can interpret. Standard scaling ensures that numerical features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, making them suitable for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
  - **Log Transformations**: Log transformations are applied to certain features to reduce skewness and improve model interpretability.
- **How It’s Better**:
  - **Standard Scaling**: Normalizes the data, which is crucial for models that rely on distance-based calculations (e.g., linear regression, SVM).
  - **Automated Feature Pipeline**: The transformation process is embedded into the pipeline, ensuring the same transformations are applied every time, regardless of new data.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: While one-hot encoding and standard scaling are common, their automation within a pipeline ensures consistency across multiple runs, reducing the risk of human error and enhancing model reproducibility.

### Modeling & Deployment
- **Experiment Tracking & Deployment**: Using MLFlow, experiments are tracked meticulously, providing insights into model performance across different runs and configurations. This allows for quick model selection based on tracked metrics.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment ensure that any new model iteration is rigorously tested and ready for production without manual intervention.
- **How It’s Better**: Traditional deployment methods lack robust tracking and version control, making it challenging to reproduce or improve models. The automated CI/CD pipeline with experiment tracking addresses these limitations, creating a streamlined deployment process.
- **Other Options & Comparison**: Manual deployment lacks the scalability and consistency required for production-grade models. MLFlow and ZenML create an effective ecosystem for deploying and maintaining models, even as new data or changes are introduced.
