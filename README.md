# Top-Notch-Data-Science-Project-Price-Prediction-Using-Core-ML-and-MLOps-Principles


## Summary
**"Building a Top-Notch Data Science Project: House Price Prediction Using Core ML and MLOps Principles"**

This project focuses on implementing both core ML techniques and MLOps principles for building an advanced, production-ready machine learning pipeline for house price prediction.
This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for house price prediction, incorporating both core ML techniques and MLOps principles. The project differentiates itself by focusing not just on building a model but on implementing advanced MLOps practices, making it robust, scalable, and production-ready.

## Key Components
** Core ML:** We focus on data understanding, assumption testing, and algorithm verification to ensure the data fits the model.
### MLOps: The project integrates CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, and experiment tracking using tools like MLFlow and ZenML.
### Code Quality: Following design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Template) to ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several stages, including:

### Data Ingestion: The data is sourced from Kaggle and includes a variety of house features. Ingestion is handled using a Factory Design Pattern to ensure flexibility in reading different data formats.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including univariate and bivariate analysis to identify key features and relationships.
### Modeling: A single algorithm is employed to build the predictive model, with suggestions to try additional models as part of an assignment.
### Experiment Tracking and Deployment: Using MLFlow and ZenML, experiments are tracked and models are deployed to production environments, following CI/CD pipelines.
### Code Quality: Design patterns are used throughout the code to improve readability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Tools & Libraries
ZenML: For orchestrating machine learning workflows.
MLFlow: For tracking experiments and deploying models.
Seaborn: For visualizations during EDA.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Design Patterns
Factory Design Pattern: Used for data ingestion.
Strategy Design Pattern: Applied in various steps like handling missing values and performing EDA.
Template Design Pattern: Utilized to standardize the analysis pipeline.
